# FRESCO - MATRIX

This repo contains functionality to make [FRESCO](https://github.com/aicis/fresco) work with
the [MATRIX](https://github.com/cryptobiu/MATRIX) benchmarking tool.

This includes classes for logging timings and printing logs in a format compatible with the MATRIX
framework (see [here](src/main/java/dk/alexandra/fresco/matrix/logging/)).

Also included is a small demo FRESCO benchmark program which can be run with MATRIX (see [here](src/main/java/dk/alexandra/fresco/matrix/demo/)), and scripts and configurations required by MATRIX in order to build and run the demo (see [here](MATRIX)).
